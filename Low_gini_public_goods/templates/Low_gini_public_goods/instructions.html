    <p>
        You are given {{ Constants.endowment }} for every round.
        All members in the group are playing for points, while limiting the spread of a virus.
        In each round, every participant in the group decides how much they self-isolate in order to
        limit the spread of the virus. Self-isolation costs points, for example: moderate self-isolation costs
        20% of that round's points and complete self-isolation costs 40% of that round's points.
    </p>
    <p>
        A randomly assigned participant is 'Patient Zero'; they have the virus.
        You do not know who it is (it could be you). If Patient Zero comes in contact
        with a member of the general population because both parties don't self-isolate
        sufficiently, then Patient Zero can give the virus to that person. If half the people
        in the group have the virus, then your group will go into lockdown for two rounds.
        In lockdown, you earn much less money (30% of that round's points).
    </p>
    <p>
        Each round, you will first be asked how much you would self-isolate if you
        knew how much the others would self-isolate that round. Then you will be asked
        how much you will actually self-isolate (but you won't know how much others are self-isolating).
        The earnings from the project are calculated as follows:
        Your endowment in each round will depend on whether you are in lockdown, and your endowments are
        occasionally reshuffled. Each round's payoff equals the sum of your earnings per round, minus the
        amount you contribute.
