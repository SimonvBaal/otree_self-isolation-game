        Instructions

    <p>
        You are given {{ Constants.endowment }} for every round (called endowment).
        Every participant can choose how much to stay home (self-isolate) in order to
        limit the spread of the virus. Self-isolation costs points, for example: moderate self-isolation costs
        20% of that round's points and complete self-isolation costs 40% of that round's points.
        If your group is in lockdown, everybody only earns a fraction of that round's points.
    </p>

    <p>
        Each round, you will first be asked how much you would self-isolate if you
        knew how much the others in your group would self-isolate that round. Then you will predict what
        others will do in that round. You will also be asked how much you will actually self-isolate
        (but you won't know how much others are self-isolating). The earnings from the project are calculated
        as follows:

    <p>
        Your endowment in each round will depend on whether you are in lockdown, but is otherwise 100 points.
        Each round's payoff equals your endowment, minus the amount you contribute by self-isolating.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please do your best to answer each question because we cannot pay you for rounds where you didn't answer
        every question.
